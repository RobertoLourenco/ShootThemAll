# Shoot Them All HTML5 Game

This is a simple game built with the HTML5 canvas element, based on classic [Space Invaders](http://www.freeinvaders.org/) game. Feel free to fork it and play with it!

## Download

You can fork the project or simply directly download it to your computer. In the terminal console, you have to type the command "bower install" in order to download jQuery as a dependency of your project. Or, if you prefer, you can link to your local jQuery installation or use a remote [CDN](https://code.jquery.com/).

## How to play

Use the left, right and space keys on your keyboard to play. Have fun!
